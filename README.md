# UCF-People-Directory
Directory viewer for the UCF People Custom Post Type

Use [ucf_people_directory] shortcode on a page

You can specify a specific category by using [ucf_people_directory people_group='slug-of-category'].

When a category is specified, the page does not print out a listing of other categories, and the search
bar is restricted to searching within that category.

When a category is not specified, the page lists all contacts and prints out a list of categories for
the user to filter down to. The search bar will search for contacts within all categories.
